# QA Advanced Prompting
**Turning AI into a testing partner for Automation QA.**

This repository hosts a practical **QA Prompt Library** focused on automation workflows (Cypress/Playwright/API), plus examples and templates you can adapt in your team.

> The better we ask, the better we test.

---

## 📚 What’s inside
- `prompts/QA_Prompt_Library.md` — 10+ advanced prompts for automation QA (test design, flaky analysis, refactoring, data generation, reporting).
- `examples/` — copy‑paste friendly examples (Cypress focused).
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` — quick templates for requests/feedback.

## 🧠 Why this exists
Prompt engineering is becoming a **core QA skill**. These prompts are structured, repeatable, and designed to fit into CI/CD and code review flows — not just one‑off chats.

## 🚀 Quick start
1. Browse **prompts/QA_Prompt_Library.md**.
2. Copy a prompt, paste into your AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).
3. Add project context (domain, stack, acceptance criteria).
4. Iterate: Generate → Review → Refine → Automate.
