# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving **QA Advanced Prompting**!

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo and create a branch: `feat/your-change`.
2. If you add a new prompt:
   - Place it under `prompts/` (or expand `QA_Prompt_Library.md`).
   - Include: **Intent**, **Prompt**, **Example Input**, **Expected Output**, **Notes**.
3. If you add examples, put runnable snippets under `examples/` with a short README.
4. Open a Pull Request and fill the PR template.

## Quality bar
- Prompts must be **specific**, **measurable**, and **repeatable**.
- Prefer **role-based**, **iterative**, and **self-evaluation** patterns.
- Include at least one **automation-focused** angle (Cypress/Playwright/API).
